## Project Overview

Our system operates on real-time data feeds from the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) through the "nvdlib" package. Leveraging this API, we gain
access to comprehensive details regarding nascent vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and detailed
CVSS Analysis. Our implementation strategically assesses these factors to identify and
prioritize concerning threats.
